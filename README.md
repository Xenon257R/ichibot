# IchiBot

![Ichihime 00](assets/_meta/discordprofile.png)

The second generation of the Riichi music player. Built for personal use.

## Description

![Embed Player](assets/_meta/preview.gif)

**IchiBot** chimes in for F2P players to jam to their favorite tunes while playing Mahjong! Users pool ambient/idle tracks into a shared **[hanchan]** playlist that shuffles during play. When a player declares **Riichi**, *IchiBot* switches to an intense, action-packed track from their personal **[riichi]** playlist to throw down the gauntlet in style!

**IchiBot** works with *Discord*'s Embed system, and as such comes with a sleek GUI for accessibility.

- Comes with all OSTs found in *MahjongSoul* as baseline tracks in case users do not want to curate their own playlists.

## Notice

The code is free for viewing and repurposing. If you wish to utilize the code for your own *Discord* Bot or other simlar projects, know that  **IchiBot** is unideal for large-scale usage as it locally saves uploaded `.mp3` files for playback per user per server. Assuming the `8 MB` upload limit (for regular *Discord* users) is met every upload and the bot's 20-file limit per playlist type as well, each user will add `320 MB` of data to the bot for every server they share with it. This already brings it upwards of `1 GB` for one Mahjong table as a standard Mahjong game consists of 4 players.

You are welcome to adapt the code to your own bot. Accreditation is greatly appreciated. However, if you end up using *YouTube* links, *Spotify* or similar, I would *HIGHLY* suggest sticking to traditional music bots as they are more robust and streamlined for music and can serve the exact same purpose as this bot, just less fitted specifically for a Riichi Mahjong environment.

- *GitHub Issues* are disabled as this bot was made for personal use.

**Disclaimer:** **IchiBot** uses *Ichihime* for its theme who is a character from *MahjongSoul*. Original character copyright remains with the developers of the game: Yostar & Catfood Studio.
